# Helper app
[![CI](https://github.com/fungss/Dojo-Helper-App/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fungss/Dojo-Helper-App/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)
This is an app to help the hosts of the fortnightly Dojo hosts do the common tasks quicky and effectively. This will include making the replit repos, placing invite links in the discord channel, coping the written code to the github archive and sending a link in the discord channel. 
Updates and tickets can be found on the projects page for bounty hunters to complete.
